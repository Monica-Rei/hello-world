### And how does it work?

### Features

**Fibonacci patterns** 
You might know the Fibonacci sequence which is manifested throughout nature in the form of the so-called golden ratio. Apart from the shapes of galaxies, or plant seeds and many others, it has found its way into trading too - specifically in the form of shaping market data into Fibonacci patterns. Thanks to these patterns Autochartist identifies probable support and resistance levels which can help you with identifying trading opportunities. 

**Chart Patterns**
By working with chart patterns you are indirectly working with market psychology which is one of the aspects that is responsible for forming resistance and support lines. Chart patterns are formed by recognizing combinations of opposing resistance and support line slopes and price “bouncing” between them. Autochartist is able to distinguish 16 patterns in total which means 16 times more chances to spot trading opportunities. 

**Key levels**
Every time price bounces off of horizontal support or resistance line, Autochartist counts it as a touching point, whenever there are at least 3 touching points - Key level is established. Key levels are pointing towards the fact that market might not be ready to break through certain price which is valuable information for traders who want to set their stop-loss or take-profit levels precisely and therefore assess their risk in a more efficient way. 
 
**Volatility analysis** 
 Those who forget the history are doomed to repeat it - if you agree with this then read on. Volatility Analysis enables you to observe past volatility of traded instruments and furthermore it also gives you an insight into the future. How? By forecasting probable volatility levels in the upcoming 24 hours. This will ultimately help you not only to assess risk by setting stop-loss and take-profit levels but also to refine your personal trading strategies. 
 
**Quality indicators**
None of the mentioned features is infallible therefore Autochartist comes with yet another feature which the main purpose is to determine the reliability of tools used for technical analysis. These are called quality indicators and based on a certain characteristic they assess the overall reliability of tools you are using and display it in a comprehensible way. This will help you to decide whether to trade or not. 


Autochartist is not just one of the other tools and indicators we offer for free to clients who open a live account with us. Everything we do we do with certain purpose and that purpose is educated and confident client who is able to make informed trading decisions.

## Features

### Fibonacci patterns
Principle of these patterns is to give preview of where trader might expect next resistance or support lines based on Fibonacci ratios on a price scale. Autochartist identifies 6 different types of Fibonacci patterns based on the number of turning points, these are: 
* 3 point retracement
* 3 point extension
* ABCD
* Gartley
* Butterfly
* Drive 
### Chart patterns
These pattern formations are based on market psychology according to which support and resistance lines are drawn. It’s a combination of these opposing lines with price moving in between them that defines each pattern formation, which eventually recognizes potential market opportunities. In total, Autochartist is able to recognize 16 chart patterns based on the slope of the support or resistance lines, which will give you yet another advantage for your trading.
### Key levels
Whenever price touches horizontal support or resistance lines, a touching point is identified, after at least 3 touching points are being recognized on the same line, the key level is identified. With the increasing number of touch points, significance of key level also rises. This can help traders with either identifying potential trade opportunities or setting stop-loss or take-profit levels and therefore ultimately assessing their risk. 
### Volatility analysis
This small set of tools helps traders to observe past volatility of an instrument and also price forecast for the hours to come. Based on this information traders can effectively set stop-loss or take-profit levels or build their personal trading strategy. 
### Quality indicators
As there is always a chance that Fibonacci patterns, Chart patterns, and Key level results can be misleading, traders should use them together with their own trading judgment and not rely on them fully. That’s why Autochartist comes also with Quality indicators which determine the reliability of these tools and display it in easy to read and user-friendly way.

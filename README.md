## Features

### Fibonacci patterns
Principle of these patterns is to give preview of where trader might expect next resistance or support lines based on Fibonacci ratios on a price scale. Autochartist identifies 6 different types of Fibonacci patterns based on the number of turning points, these are: 
* 3 point retracement
* 3 point extension
* ABCD
* Gartley
* Butterfly
* Drive 
### Chart patterns
These pattern formations are based on market psychology according to which support and resistance lines are drawn. It’s a combination of these opposing lines with price moving in between them that defines each pattern formation, which eventually recognizes potential market opportunities. In total, Autochartist is able to recognize 16 chart patterns based on the slope of the support or resistance lines, which will give you yet another advantage for your trading.
### Key levels
Whenever price touches horizontal support or resistance lines, a touching point is identified, after at least 3 touching points are being recognized on the same line, the key level is identified. With the increasing number of touch points, significance of key level also rises. This can help traders with either identifying potential trade opportunities or setting stop-loss or take-profit levels and therefore ultimately assessing their risk. 
### Volatility analysis
This small set of tools helps traders to observe past volatility of an instrument and also price forecast for the hours to come. Based on this information traders can effectively set stop-loss or take-profit levels or build their personal trading strategy. 
### Quality indicators
As there is always a chance that Fibonacci patterns, Chart patterns, and Key level results can be misleading, traders should use them together with their own trading judgment and not rely on them fully. That’s why Autochartist comes also with Quality indicators which determine the reliability of these tools and display it in easy to read and user-friendly way.

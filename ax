What is Axiory Indicator?
======

This new analytic tool is able to analyze trends of currency pairs. It is based on a very complex mathematical model that can 
capture market movement and identify the current start of a trend. It was made by forex specialists using millions of 
historical data.

The Indicator clearly shows the expected market movement, so it is easy to read for everyone. Blue color signals an uptrend 
and a red color indicates a downtrend. It clearly shows the assumed market direction.

# Why is it unique?

* It displays absolute minimum false signals
* When the color changes, there is a high chance of starting a trend
* There is no fake red painting every second
* It does not repaint on closed candlesticks
* When it signals a trend, it isn’t influenced by a correction
* It can often signal a trend all the way to the very end
* It can often identify a trend right from the beginning – it is not delayed
